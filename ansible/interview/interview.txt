Cloud Access Control

#

- How would you control access to a cloud network?
- you can control access of the control network through choosing specific communication protocols like ssh which
- uses port 22 and http with used port 80 and you can configre the way this protocols work through inbound security
- to set who can contact this ip or not and who can contact this virtual machine or not and also you can use monitoring
- through applications like kibana which analyse your logs to watch if there is any suspecious activity.
- restate proplem
- we have creeated several web machines and and make them available in one availabilty zone and conected in one virtual network 
- group the first proplem we have was we were unable to connect to the vm through the terminal from my computer
- so we have to make sure that user name and public key is set up correcrtly and no spelling errors is there and
- then we have to make sure that inbound security rules is in place so we can to avoid the technical problems
- so we set up ssh rule that allow our decvice can access the network.also we added rule to aloow
- http access to the network. 
## 


- in our project we used cloud security all of the vm we used the same setting of nsg which is a good benefit 
- of using the cloud which saves resources .
- we have to configure our access control to our network by configuring the virtual network which
- contains the inbound security rules which we have to configure to allow the devices we want
- to access and to prevent all other devices from accessing our network.
- we created network security group that included inbound security rules on it that is very necessary
- because without these rules we cannot have remote access to the vms and without these rules our network
-  will be very vulnerable as well
- these details are important because they are related to any security specialist who is trying to have perfect
- security setup for his work

###

- we implemnted network security groups whithin virtual network also we can set up firewalls whithin the hosts
- or have it implemented on the network as a hardware.
- we build our security groups inside our virtual networks to make sure that we have secure access to our virtual machine
- also within our securiy groups we set the inbound rules like ssh and http and deny other access
- these rules insure authenticaion and authrization and insure the integrity and confedintiality of our network
- and the data going in and out of it. firewalls are very important to insure integrety of data to stop any suspicous packets from
- accessing the network . we used inbound security rules ssh port 22 to access the vm from personal machine and also set port
- 80 http to access from outside and we set rule to deny all other traffic.
- access control achieved confedentiality and integrety and availabilty to my network and the data within it
- restriction was needed to lower the vulnurability risk of letting anyone of accessing the network.

####

- for web1 we allowed ssh port 22 and http from port 80 and deny all other access
- for DVWA VM2 we allowed ssh port 22
- for green user we allowed port 22 and 5601
- we can access the jumpbox by using the start and attach the docker container command and then ssh into it
- and we can access the web server from jump box by using vpn.VPN creates a direct connection between your local_
- network and a remote network. VPN can encrypt all network traffic between your current network or device and your remote network
- Once you are connected to the VPN, you have full access to all resources on the remote network, as if you were locally connected

#####

- advanteges of vpn
- protect your online identity
- secure online connection
- bypass geo-blocking
- prevent bandwidth throttling
- protect file sharing
- anonymity

disadvantages of vpn

- quality vpn is expensive
- free vpn is not secure
- vpn connection may drop
- not built for all devices

- the disadvantages of implementing a VPN that kept you from doing it this time is cost because when using the cloud cost is a big factor
- depending on the company budget . it is appropriate to use the vpn when you try to access the company from somewhere remote from the network
